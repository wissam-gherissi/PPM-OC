This repository contains the code material necessary to reproduce experimental results of the paper "Object-centric predictive process monitoring" by Wissam Gherissi, Joyce El-Haddad and Daniela Grigori.

In this code, we use a deep learning architecture with LSTM layers on an object-centric event log to predict the following tasks: Next activity, next event time, remaining sequence time.

After installing the required packages, the code allows the training and evaluation of the model for the mentioned tasks on different examples extracted from an order management object-centric event log.
